We have 2 branches which are CNNGRU and transformer.


In the transformer branch,
there are 3 types of codes which are IsometricHandGestures, Delsys, and Main.

For the IsometricHandGestures, you should check this link for data descriptions.

Utilizing the data, we performed a gesture classification task and a force regression task.

For the Delsys codes, we utilized the trigno delsys in our lab to directly acquire data for elbow joint angle regression. 
If you need related data, please request again.

For the Main codes, data was acquired through experiments utilizing fabricated sEMG electrodes and strain sensors.
If you need that data as well, please request it.
